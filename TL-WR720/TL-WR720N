On tplink router TL-WR720N v4, firmware version
3.17.1 Build 131021 Rel. 36123n has an arbitrary file reading vulnerability that does not require authentication

The cause of this vulnerability is because a path loginFs that anyone can call has been added to the httpd function through the httpCtrlConfAdd
function, and the processing function of this path did not properly handle the "../" input

We can't download v4 firmware from the official website of tplink. I analyzed by removing the firmware from the device.
